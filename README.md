## Workshop: Containerization on RMACC Summit with Singularity

### Date: 
Wednesday, May 20, 2020, 1:30 pm - 3:00 pm

### Location: 

_This course is only offered online_: The Zoom number will be emailed to you.


### Instructors 
Andrew Monaghan and Daniel Trahan, Research Computing, University of Colorado

### Description: 
Would you like to be able to move, share or publish your software without worrying whether it will work properly on other computers? Containerization is an OS-level virtualization method used to deploy and run distributed applications without launching an entire virtual machine for each app. Containers are "stand-alone", enabling workflows to be easily packaged and shared across platforms, enhancing reproducibility and portability. This hands-on tutorial by CU Research Computing staff will provide an introduction to containers and the basics of building and running containers with Singularity. Singularity is containerization software used on high performance computing platforms where users do not have escalated privileges.

__Agenda__
* 15 min: Intro to containers
* 15 min: Singularity basics
